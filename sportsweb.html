        <div class="ab"><br><h1>About Magnus Carlsen</h1><br>
        <p>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990)[1][2] is a Norwegian chess grandmaster who is the current
             World Chess Champion, World Rapid Chess Champion, and World Blitz Chess Champion. Carlsen first reached the
              top of the FIDE world rankings in 2010, and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest rated
            player in the world. His peak classical rating of 2882 is the highest in history. Carlsen also holds the
             record for the longest unbeaten run in classical chess.[3]

            A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned
             13, and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At age 15, he won the Norwegian Chess
              Championship, and at 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at
              age 18 and reached number one in the FIDE world rankings aged 19, becoming the youngest person ever to achieve
               those feats.
            
            Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. In the following year, he retained
             his title against Anand, and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, thus
              becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat he repeated in 2019. He defended
               his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, and against Fabiano Caruana in 2018.
            
            Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a
             variety of openings to make it more difficult for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the effect of
              computer analysis. He has stated the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it "comes down to pure
               chess". His positional mastery and endgame prowess have drawn comparisons to former world champions Bobby
                Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov.
                Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990,[1] to Sigrun Øen, a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[4] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[5] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.[6]

                His father, a keen amateur chess player,[7] taught him to play chess at the age of 5, although he initially
                 showed little interest in the game.[8] He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that one of the things
                  that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.
                  [9]
                
                The first chess book Carlsen read was a booklet named Find the Plan by Bent Larsen,[10] and his first book
                 on openings was Eduard Gufeld's The Complete Dragon.[11] Carlsen developed his early chess skills playing
                  by himself for hours on end—moving the pieces around, searching for combinations, and replaying games
                   and positions shown to him by his father. Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen's exceptional memory, 
                   stating that he was able to recall the areas, population numbers, flags and capitals of all the countries
                   in the world by the age of five. Later, Carlsen had memorised the areas, population numbers, coat-of-arms
                    and administrative centres of "virtually all" 356 Norwegian municipalities.[12] Carlsen participated in 
                    his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at the age of 8 years
                     and 7 months, and scored 6½/11.[13]Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the
                      country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[4] who in turn cites Norwegian football
                       manager Egil "Drillo" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.[14] In 2000, Agdestein
                        introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later
                         International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM),[15] as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste
                          (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college.

                     Over the course of that year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000, to 1907. Carlsen's
                      breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where Carlsen 
                      scored 3½/5 against the top junior players of the country, and a performance rating (PR) of about
                       2000.[16] Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, Carlsen's favourite
                        pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics.[17] Carlsen also practised
                         skiing until the age of ten.[18]
                     
                     From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well
                      as several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events.[19] In October 2002, he
                       placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola.[20] The following month, he tied
                        for first place in the World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian
                         Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak.[21] After this, he obtained three IM norms in relatively quick 
                         succession; his first was at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR), the
                          second was at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR), and the 
                          third and final IM norm was obtained at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR)
                          . He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.[22]
                     
                     After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess
                      tournaments held in Europe during the autumn of 2003, returning to complete secondary education at a
                       sports school.[23][24] During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European
                        Under-14 Championship[25] and ninth in the World Under-14 Championship.[26]</p></div><br><br>

            <div class="ab2"><h1>Prizes won</h1>
            <p>CHENNAI: Magnus Carlsen survived a fierce fightback from Hikaru Nakamura to clinch his first Meltwater
                 Champions Chess Tour title on Sunday. The World Champion broke his duck in the $1.5 million Tour events
                  at the fifth attempt with a 3-1 final set victory that sealed the New In Chess Classic.
                "I'm really, really relieved," Carlsen said. "I'm just so happy to have won one of these tournaments,
                 it feels really good." Carlsen takes the $30,000 top prize, 50 Tour points to leapfrog Wesley So into
                  first place, and the Norwegian gets bragging rights against his old rival. Nakamura, who fought
                   valiantly, cashes in $15,000 for his second prize.
                The American, one set behind after the first day, had got off to the perfect start by dominating game 1
                 almost from start to finish. Nakamura dominated the second too as Carlsen looked like he might just
                  crack. But ahead in the set, Nakamura allowed Carlsen a draw by repetition. The champ escaped and
                   Nakamura missed an opportunity to turn the screw. It proved crucial.
                If Nakamura was left regretting that decision, he would have regretted being too aggressive in game 3 even
                 more. Carlsen's killer instinct kicked in as soon as he spotted a weakness and made Nakamura pay the
                  consequences. Nakamura's lead vanished and he found himself going into game 4 in a must-win situation
                   with the black pieces.
                Needing just a draw, the game went Carlsen's way from the start. Nakamura eventually conceded the
                 inevitable and accepted a draw. Carlsen had won the New In Chess Classic and pumped his arms in
                  relief.
                Meanwhile, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, playing in his first Tour event, won the battle for third place
                 beating Levon Aronian 2.5-0.5. The Meltwater Champions Chess Tour will be back on May 23 with the
                  sixth leg. There are four tournaments to go before the big final in San Francisco.</p></div>
